    <p>The term open source refers to something people can modify and share
because its design is publicly accessible. The open-source model is a
decentralized software-development model that encourages open
collaboration. Its mainly used to describe software. The user can also
make changes in the source code of such software and customize it
according to their use. <span id="continue-reading"></span></p>
<p>The term originated with regards to software development to assign a
specific approach to create computer programs. Today, however, 'open
source' assigns a broader set of values what we call &quot;the open source
way.&quot; Open source projects, products or initiatives embrace and commend
standards of open exchange, collaborative participation, rapid
prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-oriented
development.</p>
<p>Open source supports universal access to a product's design or
blueprints via an open-source or libre license, as well as universal
redistribution of that design or blueprint. The open-source model is a
decentralized software-development model that encourages open
collaboration.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-open-source">What is Open-Source?</h2>
<p>Open source is source code that is made unreservedly accessible for
possible modification and redistribution. Products include permission to
use the source code, design documents, or content of the product.
Generally, open source refers to a computer program in which the source
code is available to the general public for use or modification from its
original design. Code is released under the terms of a software license.
Depending on the license terms, others may then download, modify, and
publish their version back to the community.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-open-source-software">What is open-source software?</h2>
<p>Open-source software is software with source code that anyone can
inspect, modify, and enhance. &quot;Source code&quot; is the part of the software
that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer
programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software a &quot;program&quot;
or &quot;application&quot; works. Programmers who have access to a computer
program's source code can improve that program by adding features to it
or fixing parts that don't always work correctly. Many open-source
projects have a high economic value. According to the Battery
Open-Source Software Index (BOSS), the ten economically most important
open source projects are:</p>

<h2 id="advantages-of-using-open-source-software">Advantages of using open source software</h2>
<p><strong>Control -</strong> We can examine the code to make sure it's not doing
anything we don't want it to do and we can change parts of it we don't
like. Users who aren't programmers also benefit from open-source
software, because they can use this software for any purpose they wish
not merely the way someone else thinks they should.</p>
<p><strong>Education -</strong> It helps us become better programmers. Because
open-source code is publicly accessible, students can easily study it as
they learn to make better software. Students can also share their work
with others, inviting comments and critiques, as they develop their
skills. When people discover mistakes in programs' source code, they can
share those mistakes with others to help them avoid making those same
mistakes themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Security -</strong> It is more secure and stable than proprietary software.
Because anyone can view and modify open-source software, someone might
spot errors or omissions that a program's original authors might have
missed. They can fix, update, and upgrade open-source software more
quickly than they can proprietary software.</p>
<p><strong>Stability -</strong> Users prefer open-source software for important,
long-term projects. Because programmers publicly distribute the source
code for open-source software, users relying on that software for
critical tasks can be sure their tools won't disappear or fall into
disrepair if their original creators stop working on them.</p>

<h2 id="women-s-contributions-to-open-source">Women's contributions to Open Source</h2>
<p>It’s certainly true that most open source efforts start as technical
projects, and a lot of the contributions needed are in the form of code.
Code was and is highly valued and rewarded by the institutions of open
source. If your team is anything less than an equal balance of men and
women, then your team is probably not the best it can be. Many women
make important contributions to an open-source project or the
open-source community. For instance, Netha Hussain, Megan Byrd-Sanicki.</p>
<h3 id="netha-hussain">Netha Hussain</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Believe in yourself, and know that you have the skills and talent to
do whatever you’d like to do. Follow your passion, and do what you
want. There will be times of uncertainty but always move forward. Keep
studying. Keep learning new things. That’s how you grow, both in your
field and as a person.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Number of years as an open-source contributor:</strong> 10</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Projects or communities:</strong> Wikimedia, Mozilla, TED</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Summary of contributions:</strong> Netha won the 2020 Academic Award for
openly sharing her medical knowledge and increasing the number of
topics relevant to women and contributions by women on Wikipedia.
Netha is a medical doctor and a PhD candidate in Clinical Neuroscience
at the University of Gothenburg. Her research involves using virtual
reality technology for individuals who have had a stroke. Netha has
made thousands of contributions related to healthcare and women in
English and Malayalam languages to Wikipedia, Wikidata, and Wikimedia
Commons. She has organized Wikipedia outreach events for women and
LGBTQ+ communities in India. She has translated Mozilla projects and
TED talks into the Malayalam language. Her dedication to being a part
of a solution through knowledge sharing has led her to currently focus
on creating and curating articles about COVID-19 on Wikipedia.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="megan-byrd-sanicki">Megan Byrd-Sanicki</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Be the leader you need. When there’s a void in leadership, each
individual can fill that void for themselves. Every contributor to
open source is a leader, whether they’re leading others, leading the
community, or just leading themselves. Don’t wait to be given
permission and own your awesome.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Number of years as an open-source contributor:</strong> 10</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Projects or communities:</strong> Drupal, Open Source Initiative, Go, Linux
Foundation, SustainOSS, Covid Act Now, FOSS Responders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Summary of contributions:</strong> Megan won the 2020 Community Award for her
leadership in creating sustainable and thriving open source communities.
Her work as the executive director of the Drupal Association led to a
stronger and more sustainable community through the development of
revenue models, the introduction of a mentorship program, and the
promotion of an inclusive environment for contributors with different
skill sets and backgrounds. Through her work as the manager of research
and operations at the Open Source Program Office at Google and as a
member of the board of directors of the Open Source Initiative, Megan
shares lessons learned from individual communities with the open-source
community more broadly and strengthens community-to-corporate
partnerships. Megan is credited for showing care for contributor
wellbeing throughout her open-source efforts. She has currently involved
with Covid Act Now, a COVID-19 data modelling project, and with FOSS
Responders, a centralized initiative to support open source communities.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Open source promotes universal access to a product's design or
blueprints through an open-source or licenses agreement, as well as
universal redistribution of that design or blueprint. The best part of
these products is, they can work the same way as the other paid products
that perform the same task. This allows individuals and companies to
review and modify the source code, blueprint, or design for their
customization, curiosity, or troubleshooting needs. It is preferred by
professionals and companies in its early stage due to its being easily
available as open-source licensed software. If we want to perform any
task, we can give it a try to check if the software to do that work is
available as open source. That could help us reduce the project cost.</p>
